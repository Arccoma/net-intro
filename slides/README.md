Slides
------

These slides use a unique format.  The master copies are in Markdown and then the script

    python3 slides.py

Produces the HTML versions of the slides.

You can run the program to extract all the "slides" from the content of the book
as follows:

    python3 extract.py

This will put the extracted MKD files in the directory `convert`.    If you 
are running `extract.py` for the first time, you shuld copy all of the MKD files
up into this folder.
