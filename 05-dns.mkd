The Domain Name System
======================

\index{Domain Name System}
\index{DNS}
The Domain Name System lets you access websites by name, so you don't have to
keep a list of numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses like "212.78.1.25" for
all the servers that you need to communicate with throughout a day.  If you recall,
IP address are determined by where your computer connects to the Internet.  When
you have a portable computer and you move from one location to another, you get
a new IP address at each new location.  Since no one connects to your portable
computer, it does not matter if your IP address changes from time to time. But
since so many people connect to a web server, it would be inconvenient if
the server moved to a new location and needed to change its IP address.   While
servers do need an assigned IP address, we also give servers a textual Domain
Name address like www.khanacademy.org.

When your computer makes a connection to a system using a Domain Name address,
the first thing your computer does is look up the IP address that corresponds
to the Domain Name.   Then your computer makes the connection using the IP
address.   Adding the separate step of looking up the IP address for a DNS
address also makes it easier to move a server from one location to another.
The server is given a new IP address and the entry for the domain address is
updated.   Once the DNS entry is updated, new requests for the domain name are
given the new IP address.  Since end users access most servers using domain
names and never see the IP address, a server can be moved to a new network
connection without affecting the end user's ability to access the server.

Allocating Domain Names
-----------------------

\index{ICANN}
\index{.com}
\index{.org}
\index{.edu}
If you recall from the previous section, IP addresses are allocated based on
where you connect a new network to the Internet.   Domain names are allocated
based on organizations that "own" the domain name.  At the top of the domain
name hierarchy there is an organization called the International
Corporation for Assigned Network Names (ICANN).   ICANN chooses the top-level
domains like .com, .edu, and .org and assigns those to other organizations to
manage.  ICANN also assigns two-letter top-level domain names like .us, .za,
.nl, and .jp to countries around the world.

Once a domain name is assigned to an organization, the controlling organization
is allowed to assign subdomains within the domain.  As an example, the .edu
top-level domain is assigned to the Educause organization.   Educause assigns
domains like umich.edu to higher education institutions.   Once the University
of Michigan is given control of umich.edu, it can make its own choices for
subdomains within its new domain.  Domains ending in .com and .org can be purchased
by individuals and the individual owners of those domains are allowed to manage
their domain and create subdomains under it for their own use or use by others.

Reading Domain Names
--------------------

When we look at an IP address like "212.78.1.25" the left prefix is the
"Network Number" so in a sense we read IP addresses from left to right, where
the left part of the IP address is the most general part of the address and
right part of the address is most specific:

    212.78.1.25
    Broad ----> Narrow

For Domain Names, we read from right to left:

    drchuck.personal.si.umich.edu
    Narrow       <---       Broad

The most general part of this domain name is ".edu" which means higher
education institutions.  The subdomain is "umich.edu" is a particular higher
education institution.

Summary
-------

While the Domain Name System is not one of our four layers in the model, it is
an important part of making the Internet easier to use.  Domain Names allow
end users to use symbolic names for servers instead of numeric Internet
Protocol addresses.  By adding a service that maps Domain Names to IP
addresses, we can move servers from one Internet connection to another
connection without requiring users to manually change their configurations
to connect to a server.


Questions
---------

as they move from one WiFi to another
